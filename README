This application finds the Nth prime number by filtering all candidate integers
(in parallel) up to a known upper bound. The candidates are filtered in batches
against batches of prime factors, which are collected on-demand from the known
primes computed thus far. The computation is seeded by computing a small set of
prime numbers serially. The confirmed prime batches are counted to determine
the Nth prime number, which is printed as the final result.

There are two implementations of this application. The ocr directory has an
implementation using the OCR v0.9 API directly. The CnC-OCR directory has a
version that uses the CnC API on top of OCR v0.9. Both directories have a
run_test.sh script to build and test the applications.
